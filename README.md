# Take Note!

## Purpose
For this challenge, I wanted to create a notetaker app. The user is presented with a landing page. Once they click the "Get Started" button, they are directed to their notes page. This app allows a user to write, save, edit, and delete notes. The user can leave the page and the notes with remain on the page until deleted by the user.
